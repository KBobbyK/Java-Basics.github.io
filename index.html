    <h1>Java Introduction</h1>
    <h2>What is Java?</h2>
    <p>
      Java is popular high-level, class-based object oriented programming
      language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995.
      Currently Java is owned by Oracle and more than 3 billion devices run
      Java.

      Java is popular high-level, class-based object oriented programming
      language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995.
      Currently Java is owned by Oracle and more than 3 billion devices run
      Java. Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and
      the various versions of UNIX. Java is used to develop numerious types of
      software applications like Mobile apps, Web apps, Desktop apps, Games
      and much more.
    </p>
    <h2>Why to Learn Java?</h2>
    <p>
      Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great
      Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software
      Development Domain. If you will conduct a servey about the best
      programming language, Java is sure to come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Java is fairly easy to learn, so if you are starting to learn any
      programming language then Java could be your great choice. There's also
      plenty of Java tools that make it easy for developers and beginners to
      use. There are many other good reasons which makes Java as the first
      choice of any programmer:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Java is Open Source which means its available free of cost.</li>
      <li>Java is simple and so easy to learn</li>
      <li>Java is much in demand and ensures high salary</li>
      <li>Java has a large vibrant community</li>
      <li>Java has powerful development tools</li>
      <li>Java is platform independent</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Java Applications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Multithreaded</strong> - With Java's multithreaded feature it
        is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks
        simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to construct
        interactive applications that can run smoothly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interpreted</strong> - Java byte code is translated on the fly
        to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. The
        development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking is
        an incremental and light-weight process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>High Performance</strong> - With the use of Just-In-Time
        compilers, Java enables high performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Distributed</strong> - Java is designed for the distributed
        environment of the internet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dynamic</strong> - Java is considered to be more dynamic than
        C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment.
        Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that
        can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Java - Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems
      which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core
      component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]).
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8. With the
      advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple
      configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. For
      example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME
      respectively. Java is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere.
    </p>
    <h4>Java is -</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Object Oriented</strong>- In Java, everything is an Object.
        Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Platform Independent</strong>- Unlike many other programming
        languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not
        compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform
        independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and
        interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is
        being run on.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simple</strong>- Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you
        understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Secure</strong>- With Java's secure feature it enables to
        develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are
        based on public-key encryption.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Architecture-neutral</strong>- Java compiler generates an
        architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code
        executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime
        system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Portable</strong>- Being architecture-neutral and having no
        implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java
        portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean
        portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Robust</strong>- Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone
        situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and
        runtime checking.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Hello World using Java Programming</h2>
    <pre>
        <code class="code">
        public class MyFirstJavaProgram {

            /* This is my first java program.
             * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
             */
         
            public static void main(String []args) {
               System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World
            }
         }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <h2>History of Java</h2>
    <p>
      James Gosling initiated Java language project in June 1991 for use in
      one of his many set-top box projects. The language, initially called
      'Oak' after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office, also went
      by the name 'Green' and ended up later being renamed as Java, from a
      list of random words. Sun released the first public implementation as
      Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA), providing
      no-cost run-times on popular platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      On 13 November, 2006, Sun released much of Java as free and open source
      software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On 8
      May, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of Java's core code free
      and open-source, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not
      hold the copyright.
    </p>
    <h2>Tools You Will Need</h2>
    <p>
      For performing the examples discussed in this tutorial, you will need a
      Pentium 200-MHz computer with a minimum of 64 MB of RAM (128 MB of RAM
      recommended).
    </p>
    <p>You will also need the following softwares -</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Linux 7.1 or Windows xp/7/8 operating system</li>
      <li>Java JDK 8</li>
      <li>Microsoft Notepad or any other text editor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When we consider a Java program, it can be defined as a collection of
      objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now
      briefly look into what do class, object, methods, and instance variables
      mean.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Object</strong>- Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A
        dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as
        wagging their tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a
        class.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Class</strong>- A class can be defined as a template/blueprint
        that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type
        supports.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Methods</strong>- A method is basically a behavior. A class
        can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are
        written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Instance Variables</strong>- Each object has its unique set of
        instance variables. An object's state is created by the values
        assigned to these instance variables.
      </li>
    </ul>
